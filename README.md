# FBFriendsImageList
Only Facebook friends who have logged in using your app would be shown in the list view along with their name and profile picture.
Facebook have restricted direct access to friends list so we can only access those mentioned above.
So, create a new app id for your app using developer page of facebook and start using the code.
